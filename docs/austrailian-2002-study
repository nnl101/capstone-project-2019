Aim: To examine the utility of two indicators of opioid overdose in comparison with Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on opioid-related deaths in NSW, Australia

There is a need to identify
indicators that provide valid, reliable and timely information about trends in opioid overdoses
(most of which are due to illicit heroin use (Darke, Ross, Zador, & Sunjic, 2000)).

This means that deaths included here are only
those in which it was considered that opioids such as heroin, morphine, pethidine, methadone
and codeine were primarily responsible for the personâ€™s death

RESULTS
The age distribution of all three data sources was consistent. Approximately 95% of ABS
opioid overdose cases were aged 15-54 years, while 94% and 93% of ambulance attendance
patients and DAL cases, respectively, were within this age range. The majority of cases were
male in both ABS and DAL cases, with females more highly represented among ambulance
attendances. Over the period, 81% of ABS cases, 69% of ambulance cases, and 82% of DAL
cases were male


Figure 1 analysis:
- Time series analyses revealed no evidence of a seasonal trend for any of the indicators of
heroin related harm.
- Consistent with previous research examining heroin overdoses (Darke et
al., 2000) there was no evidence of a pattern of overdoses that changed according to the month
of each yea

Table 1 analysis: 
  - Cross-correlations (95%SE) of ABS, DAL and ambulance attendance data
    - This is probably the point Emma was referring to about there being no predictive ability of data between when examining data that is older than a month. 
    - But the table represents the cross correlation b/w ABS and DAL numbers month over month. Does the fact that two month don't have high cross-correlation mean that we can predict the rate of growth (slope) of mortality from EMS data? (I'm not sure)
