## Review of paper - Early indicators of trends in opioid overdose deaths 

### Link Reference - https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/resource/early-indicators-trends-opioid-overdose-deaths

### Aim: To examine the utility of two indicators of opioid overdose in comparison with Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on opioid-related deaths in NSW, Australia

### About the data:
Two types of DAL data are included in this paper, which include cases of death between July
1994 and June 2001. These data are as follows:
a) All cases in which the deceased was identified by either police or pathologists as **an illicit
drug** user or “known drug taker”; and
b) Cases in which the deceased was identified by either police or pathologists as an illicit drug
user or “known drug taker”, and morphine was detected in the deceased

- There is a need to identify
indicators that provide valid, reliable and timely information about trends in opioid overdoses
(most of which are due to illicit heroin use (Darke, Ross, Zador, & Sunjic, 2000)).

- This means that deaths included here are only
those in which it was considered that opioids such as heroin, morphine, pethidine, methadone
and codeine were primarily responsible for the person’s death

### Results
The age distribution of all three data sources was consistent. Approximately 95% of ABS
opioid overdose cases were aged 15-54 years, while 94% and 93% of ambulance attendance
patients and DAL cases, respectively, were within this age range. The majority of cases were
male in both ABS and DAL cases, with females more highly represented among ambulance
attendances. Over the period, 81% of ABS cases, 69% of ambulance cases, and 82% of DAL
cases were male

### Figure 1 analysis:
- Time series analyses revealed no evidence of a seasonal trend for any of the indicators of
heroin related harm.
- Consistent with previous research examining heroin overdoses (Darke et
al., 2000) there was no evidence of a pattern of overdoses that changed according to the month
of each year

### Table 1 analysis: 
  - Cross-correlations (95%SE) of ABS, DAL and ambulance attendance data
    - This is probably the point Emma was referring to about there being no predictive ability of data between when examining data that is older than a month. 
    - But the table represents the cross correlation b/w ABS and DAL numbers month over month. Does the fact that two month don't have high cross-correlation mean that we can predict the rate of growth (slope) of mortality from EMS data? (I'm not sure)
    
### Description:
This study has shown that two leading edge indicators of heroin overdose – ambulance
attendances at drug overdoses, and deaths in which persons were suspected “drug users”
and morphine was detected – have a strong correlation with an accepted “gold standard”
indicator of opioid overdoses, namely ABS coded deaths. Both ambulance attendances
and DAL cases appear to be **valid indicators of opioid overdoses**

Ambulance and DAL data **may also be used to predict trends in overdoses**. The present
study found that both ambulance attendance and DAL data were significantly correlated
with ABS coded deaths up to two (ambulance calls) or three months (DAL data) later.
This means that such data may be used to gain an understanding of future trends for a
limited time period. 

However, these data **cannot be used to predict overdoses for any longer than three months**. Hence, it is not valid to make any predictions about trends for a coming year from existing data.

There was good agreement between the indicators across different geographic areas,
suggesting that **both DAL and ambulance data are relatively good indicators of
geographic trends in opioid overdose deaths.**
